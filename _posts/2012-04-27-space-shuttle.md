Not on the same day... The Space Shuttle flies past, and we also had some fun with a balloon.

<blockquote>Liz Barry, Leif Percifield, and Jason Eppnik of Public Lab along with our friends at Vizzuality set up shop on our deck and together we assembled and launched the helium balloon and camera rig.  We got it as high as 100' up from our roof. The rig snapped some great aerial pics of of our roof deck and the immediate surroundings of Chinatown and Soho.</blockquote>
